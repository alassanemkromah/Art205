        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p id="Aboutpara">The word computer is derived from the word compute. Compute means to calculate. The computer was originally defined as a super-fast calculator. It had the capacity to solve complex arithmetic and scientific problems at very high speed. But nowadays in addition to handling complex arithmetic computations, computers perform many other tasks like accepting, sorting, selecting, moving, comparing various types of information. They also perform arithmetic and logical operations on alphabetic, numeric and other types of information. This information provided by the user to the computer is data. The information in one form which is presented to the computer is the input information or input data.
            Information in another form is presented by the computer after performing a process on it. This information is the output information or output data.
            The set of instructions given to the computer to perform various operations is known as computer program. The process of converting the input data into the required output form with the help of the computer program is called data processing. The computers are therefore also referred to as data processors.
            A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions stored in its own memory that can accept data (input), process the data according to specified 1 rule, produce information (output), and store the information for future use.
            The computer system is made of two components.
